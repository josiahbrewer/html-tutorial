#Lesson One: GitHub Tutorial
In this lesson we are going to learn the very basics of using git with GitHub and Sourcetree. When you go to do this, let's sit down together and go through all the directions below. You are in the command chair. I will only be there for questions. It's your job to start learning how to be patient and diligent with your work. I don't grade on a curve, but I am going to tell you are wrong, when you are wrong. Nothing will slide. Have fun!

##Directions
- [ ] Using Atom, click File (top left) and then click "New File". create a text file with the file name
- [ ] Type `hello world, my name is Josiah Brewer.`.
- [ ] Save this file as `HelloWorld.txt` in the `/lessons/LessonOne` directory.
- [ ] Open Sourcetree and stage the `helloworld.txt` file.
- [ ] In the Sourcetree commit message add the message, `My first commit, ever.` and click the commit button
- [ ] Now, you need to push that commit to your repository (repo). Do this by click the push button in the top of the app.
- [ ] Open up your browser and go to [GitHub](http://www.github.com)
- [ ] Go to your `html-tutorial` repo and create a pull request (PR).
- [ ] Submit your pull request.
- [ ] You are finished.

##Extra Credit
1. Own your own, repeat everything above, but call the file `DadIsBest.txt` and type in that file `Dad is best.` instead.
